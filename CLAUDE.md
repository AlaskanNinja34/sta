## Architecture Overview

### Core Model: ScholarshipApplication
The application centers around the `ScholarshipApplication` model with 300+ fields covering:
- Personal information (name, DOB, contact details)
- Education history and goals
- Financial needs analysis (FNA) with detailed budget breakdown
- Various forms and releases (photo, parental, ARPA authorization)
- Administrative fields (status tracking, board decisions, award amounts)

### Controllers Structure
- `ScholarshipApplicationsController` - Student-facing application submission and status checking
- `Admin::ScholarshipApplicationsController` - Administrative interface for reviewing applications
- `Admin::DashboardController` - Admin dashboard overview
- `HomeController` - Landing page

### Views Organization
- Student views: Application form broken into logical sections (`_form_*` partials)
- Admin views: Detailed application review with sectioned display (`_show_*` partials)
- Responsive design using CSS with custom fonts (Alegreya family)

### Database Schema
Uses PostgreSQL in production, SQLite3 for development/test. Key features:
- Single large `scholarship_applications` table with comprehensive fields
- Active Storage integration for file uploads
- Indexed fields: `board_status`, `finance_grant_number`

### Routes Structure
```
/ (root)                           # Home page
/scholarship_applications/new      # Application form
/scholarship_applications/:id      # View submitted application
/check_status                      # Status lookup form
/admin/dashboard                   # Admin dashboard
/admin/scholarship_applications    # Admin application management
```

# Claude Memory System

This directory contains task-specific memory files for Claude Code interactions. Each task gets its own dedicated file for planning, tracking changes, and maintaining context.

## Directory Structure

```
claude-memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file - usage documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ TASK_TEMPLATE.md       # Template for new task files
â””â”€â”€ tasks/                 # Individual task memory files
    â”œâ”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD_task-name.md
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Task
1. Copy `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` to `tasks/YYYY-MM-DD_task-name.md`
2. Fill in the task overview and planning phase
3. Break down the work into specific steps
4. Document planned file changes

### 2. During Implementation
- Log all changes made with timestamps
- Document any issues encountered and solutions
- Update progress status regularly
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers

### 3. Task Completion
- Summarize what was accomplished
- Document any outstanding items
- Record metrics (time spent, files changed)
- Mark status as completed

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-task-name.md`

Examples:
- `2025-08-13_add-email-notifications.md`
- `2025-08-13_fix-validation-errors.md`
- `2025-08-13_refactor-admin-dashboard.md`

## Benefits

- **Context Preservation:** Maintain detailed records of all changes
- **Planning Documentation:** Think through implementations before coding
- **Problem Resolution:** Track solutions to common issues
- **Progress Tracking:** Clear visibility into task completion
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Detailed logs for future reference

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

This memory system complements the main `CLAUDE.md` file:
- `CLAUDE.md`: Contains high-level project context and development guidelines
- `claude-memory/`: Contains specific task implementation details and change logs

## Best Practices

1. **Always plan before implementing** - Use the planning phase to think through changes
2. **Log changes immediately** - Don't wait until the end to document what you did
3. **Be specific** - Include file paths, line numbers, and exact changes made
4. **Track time** - Record how long different phases take for better estimation
5. **Reference commits** - Link to git commits when applicable
6. **Update status regularly** - Keep the status field current throughout the task
